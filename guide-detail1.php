            Finding a hostel that feels like home can be a challenge, but it doesn't have to be! With a little planning and the right platform (like H2H), you can easily pick a place that's just right for you. Here's a quick and easy guide to help you out:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-8">
            <div>
                <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3">1. Think About Your Budget</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Start by setting a budget. How much can you spend on rent each month? Don't forget to include extra costs like security deposits or utilities like AC and Wi-Fi. H2H lets you compare prices and find options that fit your pocket. Affordable hostels in Lahore are just a few clicks away!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3">2. Location Matters</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    The closer your hostel is to your university or workplace, the better. It saves time and travel costs. Use H2H's filters to find hostels near your desired area, whether it's Muslim Town, Johar Town, or anywhere else in Lahore. Convenience is key, and H2H ensures you'll find hostels in Lahore's prime locations.

                <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3">3. Check the Facilities</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Do you need a mess for meals or a laundry service? Are you okay with shared rooms, or do you prefer something more private? Look for hostels with features like study areas, clean washrooms, and reliable Wi-Fi. On H2H, you can see all these details at a glance.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3">4. Safety First</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Your safety should always come first. Look for hostels with CCTV cameras, secure gates, and guards. At H2H, we verify listings so you can trust the options we show. Verified hostels in Lahore are just one of the ways we make your search stress-free.
